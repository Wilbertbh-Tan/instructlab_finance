- answer: "To predict the next value in the temperature sequence, we can look at the\
    \ pattern in the previous values. The differences between consecutive temperatures\
    \ are:\n\n2 (day 2 - day 1)\n3 (day 3 - day 2)\n3 (day 4 - day 3)\n4 (day 5 -\
    \ day 4)\n\nThis increasing difference suggests that the temperature will continue\
    \ to increase. To find the next temperature, we can add the difference from day\
    \ 4 to the temperature of day 4:\n\nNext temperature = Day 4 temperature + Difference\n\
    = 28 \xB0C + 3 \xB0C\n= 31 \xB0C\n\nTherefore, the next value in the sequence\
    \ is 31 degrees Celsius.\n"

- answer: 'To calculate the total number of fruits bought on each day we first sum
    up the number of fruits bought in each day.

    Total fruits for Day 1 = 5 (A) + 3 (B) + 2 (C) = 10

    Total fruits for Day 2 = 8 (A) + 6 (B) + 5 (C) = 19

    Total fruits for Day 3 = 4 (A) + 7 (B) + 6 (C) = 17


    Hence on Day 1 the lowest number of fruits were bought

  question: "Consider the following table representing the number of fruits bought\
    \ by three different people (A, B, C) at a fruit stall over three days (Day 1,\
